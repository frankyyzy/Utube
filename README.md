This is a project analyzing trending Youtube videos using this Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new.


What are the main factors influencing the popularity of a youtube video? Is it possible to estimate the popularity of a video based on its title, category, length, etc.? 

In this project, we compiled a jupyter notebook(FinalProject.ipynb in this repository) to examine the metadata of the videos and its relationship to the views, likes and comment counts as a measure of its popularity.

Working in a group of five, we carried out the following data science practices in our notebook:
- data scraping
- data cleaning & pre-processing
- data visualization
- data analysis
